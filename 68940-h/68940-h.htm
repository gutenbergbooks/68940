<p>[Stenographic report of Dr. Gilmour’s address at the annual meeting of the New Jersey State Charities Aid and
Prison Reform Association, April 1, 1911. Though The Review guards jealously its space, having but sixteen
pages monthly, we are sure our readers will agree with us that the space filled by this article is well filled.—Editor]</p>
</div>


<p>When we speak of criminals, we are
very apt to picture in our mind’s eye
the great criminals, those who commit
atrocious crimes. But that class forms
but a very small percentage of every
prison population, and the methods of
dealing with this class are much more
clear and definite than dealing with the
much larger class that are not quite so
dangerous to society. When we speak
of criminals we are apt to think of them
<i>en masse</i> as a congregation of a few
hundred or a few thousand men walled
within a prison. Carlyle dissipates this
view when he says: “Masses? Yea,
masses, every unit of whom has his own
heart and sorrows—stands there covered
with his own skin; and if you
prick him he will bleed.”</p>

<p>In dealing with delinquency there
are two basic facts; that the great majority
of criminals are made in their
youth, and that the great majority of
youthful criminals are handicapped in
life’s race either by physical, mental, or
moral defects. That prince of sociologists,
Victor Hugo, evidently appreciated
these conditions when he gave us
that beautiful injunction to study evil
lovingly, and then, later on, he gave
the key when he said: “There are no
bad weeds. They are only bad cultivators.”</p>

<p>Two or three weeks ago a young man
came into the corridor of our prison
one day and asked, “Warden, will you
take me out to the farm?” (A prison
farm, of which I hope to speak a little
later). I said, “No, Smith, I cannot
take you out.” Over in our country
when we wish to conceal a man’s identity
we always call him Smith; and if
we are particularly careful, we call him
John Smith. This man was a repeater;
he was doing his fifth term; the four
previous terms he had been a very difficult
man to get along with; but this
time he had done very well. We could
take no exception to either his conduct
or his industry. He said to me, “Have
I not done well this time?” I said, “You
certainly have.” “Well, then,” he said,
“Won’t you give me a chance?” Of
course, he had me there; I couldn’t refuse
him. I said, “Yes, I’ll give you a
chance.” I took him up to the farm on
a Monday; he worked well on Tuesday
and on Wednesday; and on Wednesday
night he skipped. The following
Friday we got him again, in a town one
hundred and fifty miles from home;
and I pitied the poor fellow when he
came back, he looked so dejected and
so crestfallen; but I blamed myself entirely.
I had imposed a burden of self-denial
and a responsibility of conduct
upon that man that he was not able to
bear. He was one of that class, typical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
of a considerable percentage of our
prison populations, that is on the borderland
between sanity and insanity;
and all the prison officials who are here
to-night will recall scores of that class
who form a part of their prison population.</p>

<p>As I say, I had made a mistake with
this boy; but it only goes to show that
penologists are not infallible, not even
the youngest of them. If we were to
stop to speculate upon the place that
this element occupies in the divine
scheme, we might tread upon very dangerous
ground. It is enough for us to
know that the God that made them is
the God that will judge them; and herein
lies our consolation. I had a man come
into prison a few weeks ago to do two
years; and yesterday afternoon, just an
hour before I left home for coming
down here, his wife came into my office
leading a beautiful child five years
of age by the hand. She came, as so
many poor women come, to see if it
were not possible to get some relief
from her almost intolerable position.
As the cruel truth dawned upon her
that it was impossible for me to exercise
clemency in regard to her husband,
the women turned to me and she said,
with much emphasis, “If they would
only send me and my child to prison,
how much better it would have been.”</p>

<p>And the woman expressed a great
verity. This little episode I relate to
show you that society has two obligations:
one to the man shut up within
the prison, and perhaps an even greater
obligation to the poor woman and
children dependent upon the man shut
up within the prison. It is necessary
to lock up a certain class of men that
society may be protected, and that
these men may be improved; but when
we do that, are we going to put their
families in a position in which they will
be impelled into either vice or crime?
I think it is Milton who asks the pertinent
question:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What boots it, by one gate to make defence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at another to let in the foe?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In dealing with the wives and children,
as well as with the prison inmates,
over in our place, we find an
immense help from the Salvation
Army. We have a prisoner’s aid association
and they work harmoniously
together; but the Army has one or two
advantages in this work that no other
organization possesses. In the first
place, they are not sentimentalists.
They detail one man to give his time to
it. He is as free to go into our prison
as I am; and I think he spends as much
time there as I do. He is there at
night, on Sundays, on holidays, at noon
hours; and he is going from cell to cell—he
becomes thoroughly acquainted
with every inmate. That gives that
man an immense advantage in dealing
with those men when their terms expire.
The prison worker that expects
to meet the discharged prisoner at the
prison gate the morning he comes out,
is much more apt to be worked by the
prisoner than he is to work the prisoner.
In three cases out of five he is clay
in the hands of a designing man. One
of our governors some years ago said
that Canada was a land of magnificent
distances. The same remark applies
to your republic; but we get prisoners
1,300 miles from our prison. The
Army, learning the condition of the families
dependent on the man within
the prison, writes to the corps, the Salvation
Army corps in the town or the
city where the man came from, and
they are able, by their very extensive
and highly perfected organization, to
make a study of each family, in addition
to having arrangements made
there for the employment of that man
when his term has expired. We try,
just as far as possible, to get all of our
ex-prisoners out of the city. We do
not wish them to colonize; we try to
get them back to their homes where
they came from; for unless a man is
willing to go back and face society, and
live it down, the chances are that he
will be driven into what is wrong
sometimes through fear.</p>

<p>A year ago now, we started our farm.
It is fifty miles out of the city; it contains
530 acres. I commenced by taking
up a little detachment of 14 men;
and I rapidly increased that until I
had 180 men, housed in temporary
quarters on this farm. The average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
term of the man on the farm was about
five or six months, though I had several
men there who had to do from one
to two years. So far we have taken
out to this farm 500 men, and out of
that 500, four have escaped successfully,
and three or four have attempted
to escape—unsuccessfully. The other
day a minister in our city was calling,
and I gave him these statistics, and he
looked very sad; he said it was a pity.
I said it was; “but,” I said, “can you
take 500 of your church membership
and have 495 of them make good?”
And he changed the subject.</p>

<p>I had a grand jury visit me the other
day; it is a custom, over in our country,
for the grand juries to come over a few
times a year and tell us how to run the
place (they sometimes stay an hour);
and the foreman, before he went away,
said to me, “Warden, I suppose you
select the men whom you take out to
the farm.” I said, “No, sir. I don’t.”
He said, “How do you manage?” I
said, “I select a very few whom I <i>don’t</i>
take;” for I can take 90 per cent. About
three weeks ago I was going into the
farm one day; it was a cold, snowy,
blowing, blustering day; the thermometer
was about zero. When I came
near to our building it was quarter to
twelve o’clock; and I saw men coming
from this direction, and that direction,
and from every direction pass alone;
no officers with them at all; and it impressed
me, perhaps, much more than
it would another one not engaged in
this work; for I asked myself the question—“How
is it? These are the very
men that I have had in Toronto behind
bolts and bars, watched over by guns
and guards; and here they are out here,
as free as this air that blows, and they
are all coming in to sit down with each
other at dinner.” I have asked our men
on the farm—many of them, different
types, at different places, at different
times, and I have asked them all the
same question:—“What do you find
the greatest difference as between the
prison in the city and the prison out
here on the farm?” And without a single
exception, in one form or another those
men have invariably given me the same
reply. We give good board at the
prison, but it was not that; it was not
this liberty, comparative liberty. They
have said to me: “Warden, to get away
from that cell! To get away from that
cell!”</p>

<p>I asked a boy two weeks ago, a
young man, and he said, “Warden, to
get away from that cell; for,” he said,
“to sit there on Sunday, every evening
and on holidays and have that cell gate
staring you in the face, it is hell;” and
he didn’t say it to be irreverent or disrespectful,
but it was his pent up emotions.
I believe there is something debasing—debasing
to a man’s personal
manhood—about life in a cell that no
one can describe. Our men plow, they
harrow, they sow the grain, they reap
it; there is no guard with them at all.
Of course, these are men who are near
the end of their terms, perhaps men
who have three months or less to do;
but every prison contains enough of
that class to enable them to carry on
this class of work, agricultural work,
to a financial advantage. If we had to
pay guards to be with these various
men, we couldn’t do it; but we don’t.
There is an indefinable something in
God’s out-of-doors that has a beneficial
effect upon humanity. I can not tell
you what it is. “The wind bloweth
where it listeth, and thou hearest the
sound thereof, but thou canst not tell
whence it cometh nor whither it goeth.
So is every man that is born of
the spirit.”</p>

<p>A few months ago a professor from
the University of Kansas wrote a little
poem of two or three verses; and one
of the verses reads like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A breeze on the far horizon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The infinite tender sky—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ripe, rich tint of the corn fields</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the wild geese sailing high;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all over upland and lowland</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The charm of the golden-rod:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some of us call it autumn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And others call it God.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Do you catch the spirit of those
beautiful lines? They tell (what I
should like to tell were I able) of the
way God speaks to our delinquents out
on the farm through the hazy atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and the golden sunsets; they
tell of the way God speaks to those
poor fellows through the growing and
the ripening grains, and of the message
that God sends to them through the
birds that sing and soar over their
heads. It suggests that beautiful
thought of Browning’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This world, as God has made it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Always glitters. And knowing this is love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And love is duty.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are aiming at something definite
in the construction of our new prison.
We are going to try to give that large
class of boys and young men that come
to prison for the first time one more
opportunity of going through life without
being immured in a prison cell. In
the construction of our buildings, our
domicile accommodation will be largely
of the dormitory type;—small dormitories,
accommodating 14 beds, with
a large, semi-circular bay window on
one side which will serve as a sitting
room; attached to which dormitory
will be a completely equipped bedroom
and dressing room. The corridor
which runs along the side where
the officers will patrol is divided from
these rooms that I speak of by a glass
partition, so that our men are thoroughly
under observation every hour
of the day and night, and there will be
no opportunities whatever for some of
those things that penologists so much
dread. In addition to that, we have a
number of single rooms and a number
of cells; but in a prison which is destined
to accommodate 600, we are only
putting in 40 cells. The men who behave
and who demonstrate that they
can appreciate that dormitory life and
maintain the condition of it, we hope
to give ultimately a single room; and
the men who fail to appreciate this dormitory
life and don’t behave as we wish
them to will then be demoted into a
cell; but we are going to try, as I say,
to get those boys through life, if possible,
without the cell. Will we succeed?
I don’t know. I don’t know. We have
our critics; but this world will never
be saved by the critics; it will be saved
by the dreamers. The history of humanity
is the history of indomitable
hope. Emerson says that “Every thing
is free to the man that can grasp it;”
that “He who despairs is wrong.”</p>

<p>In dealing with delinquents, it is the
personal touch that tells. Human nature
craves for sympathy. Kingsley
was once asked what the secret of his
joyous, buoyant life was; and his ready
reply was: “I had a friend.” Our
Saviour was no exception to this rule;
for as our Saviour approached Gethsemane,
he yearned for a friend whom
he could rely upon to wait and watch
while he endured; and expressed it in
that pathetic request to the drowsy
Peter and his sleepy comrades. When
we see a very simple duty staring us
in the face in dealing with this class,
we are too prone to say, “Lord, here
am I. Send him.” It is an easy matter
for a man of means to write his check,
or give his cash; but it is an entirely
different thing to carry that gift to
some poor fellow who is down and out
and sweeten it with the fragrance of
personal kindness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Not what we give, but what we share;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gift without the giver is bare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have church service at our place
every Sunday afternoon and Wednesday
afternoon; one day our preacher
failed to materialize. The men were in
the chapel; and I did not wish to have
them return to the cells without saying
something to them; as I could not
preach I thought I would do the next
best thing, and I would read another
fellow’s sermon; only, I gave the other
fellow credit for it. I was reading a
book just then that interested me very
much; and I went down to the office
and got it, and I read the first chapter;
and when I finished, I asked if I should
read more, and they said, “Yes, Warden.”
I read a second and a third
chapter; I read as long as my voice
would hold out; and as I had finished,
a man down in the audience said,
“Won’t you be kind enough to tell me
the name of that book, and the author?”
I was very glad to have them
ask the question; I told him. The next
morning when I was going through the
prison industries, the officers kept asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
me what book I read, the previous
day. I said, “Why do you ask?” They
said, “The men are all talking about
it.” I sent down town and got fifteen
copies and sent it around among the
cells, with instructions that no one man
could keep it for more than a week.
When we collected the books at the end
of the first week, I found that a great
many men had taken paper and copied
out portions of it. This was practically
a non-reading population. They had
refused a lot of good books we had put
in our library which I had thought
were fine, much to my disappointment.
Perhaps you would like to know the
kind of book they so much enjoyed;
and, with your permission, I will just
read you the first page of the first
chapter.</p>

<p>“Man has two Creators: his God, and
himself. The first creator furnishes
him the raw material of his life and
the laws of conformity with which he
can make that life what he will. His
second creator, himself, has marvelous
powers he rarely realizes. It is what a
man makes of himself that counts. If
a man fails in life he usually says, I
am as God made me. When he succeeds
in life, he proudly proclaims himself
a self-made man. Man is placed
into this world not as a finality, but as
a possibility. Man’s greatest enemy is
himself. Man in his weakness is the
creature of circumstances; man in his
strength is the creator of circumstances.
Whether he be victim or victor
depends largely on himself. Man is
never truly great, merely for what he
is, but ever for what he may become.”</p>

<p>Now, that is pretty good meat. And
that afternoon I was the one who learned
the great lesson; for I learned that
if we approach this subject in the right
way we can waken, even in dormant
minds, a desire for good literature.
And my little experience of the afternoon
revolutionized my method of
dealing with the boys in this respect.</p>

<p>My time is up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHICAGO_HOUSE_OF_CORRECTION">CHICAGO HOUSE OF CORRECTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John S. Whitman, Warden.</span></p>


<p>The Chicago House of Correction
was established and is maintained by
the City of Chicago in accordance
with the provisions of an Act of the
State Legislature, in 1871. It covers
sixty (60) acres of ground, the total
valuation of real estate, buildings and
equipment being $1,618,688.00. During
the year ending December 31st, 1910,
there were 13,083 commitments to the
institution. This total includes 1,383
women, 355 boys under 18 years of age
and 11,345 men. The daily average
population was 1,631 (a decrease from
1,766 in 1909, and this latter figure was
a decrease from 1,852, which was the
daily average during 1908). Persons
are committed for violation of state
statutes in cases of misdemeanor, and
for violation of city ordinances. In the
latter case the fine imposed is worked
out at the rate of fifty cents per day;
however, the maximum term of imprisonment
for failure to pay fine is
fixed at six months, and an allowance
of three days per month is made for
good conduct if the limit of imprisonment
is served. For violation of the
state statutes a fixed sentence is imposed
by the Court, the maximum being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
one year. For violation of certain
sections of the statutes an additional
fine may be imposed, which, if not paid,
may be worked out at the rate of $1.50
per day after sentence has been served.
The law providing for the allowance
of three days per month for good conduct
also covers these cases if confinement
is for six months or more.</p>

<p>All inmates over 18 years of age who
are not incapacitated from work by
sickness or old age, are furnished with
healthful employment; the principal
industries being those that furnish products
needed and to be used by the
City. A limited and comparatively
small percent of the inmates are employed
in the manufacture of articles
placed on the market in competition
with those manufactured by paid labor.
For instance, the city uses a great
amount of crushed stone in the repair
and building of streets. This is quarried,
crushed and loaded in the cars on
our grounds by inmates at a great saving
to the city. They are also engaged
in the manufacture of sewer brick used
by the city, the clay used in this industry
being excavated within the
walls of the institution. We also conduct
a printing shop where most of the
city’s printing is done.</p>

<p>The laundry work for the Police and
Health Departments is done here at a
great advantage to those departments.
We manufacture all clothing, shoes,
etc., that the prisoners wear. We make
all permanent improvements to buildings
and grounds as well as do the new
construction work. About one-fifth of
our inmates are engaged in the manufacture
of chairs, broom and leather
goods and these are the only articles
placed on the market.</p>

<p>The actual receipts of the institution
during the year 1909 were $210,591.48;
this amount, however, includes $38,287.00
collected as payment on fines.
In addition to the above, it is conservatively
estimated that the earnings of
the institution in making permanent
improvements and in new construction
work are not less than $148,873.00.
The total expenditures including the
purchase of materials for new construction
and of amounts appropriated
by the city to be used at the House of
Correction in its management amounted
to $291,053.03.</p>

<p>The per capita cost per diem for
feeding inmates during the year 1909
was twelve cents; the cost per diem
including all expenditures was forty-six
cents. The cost as stated above is
somewhat increased because of the fact
that we maintain as one of the departments
of the institution what is known
as the John Worthy School. This is
not a school in name only, but has all
the facilities for giving the class of
boys that are sent to us from the Juvenile
Court the education and training
they need; and their needs are
greater than those ordinarily sent to
the public schools, for most of them
have not had the chance in life to develop
physically or morally as boys
have who come from well regulated
homes where proper influence prevails,
and where they are encouraged to
profit by the educational advantages
furnished by our public schools. You
will find there not only the ordinary
class rooms with a competent teacher
in charge of each, but manual training
facilities and a well-equipped trade
school, an indoor gymnasium, as well
as outdoor play grounds and a swimming
pool. We also teach them to do
gardening and in a limited way give
them an opportunity to develop any inclinations
they may have to follow an
agricultural life.</p>

<p>I desire to call particular attention
to a cell house recently built here for
men, in which there are 334 cells, each
having an outside window which can
be operated by the occupant of the cell.
Each cell is also equipped with high
class plumbing, including wash basin;
in fact, sanitary conditions are as perfect
as it seemed possible to make
them. You will find no dark corners in
the building or places where the ventilation
is not perfect. The valuation
has been conservatively fixed at $225,000.
The actual cost is less than
$65,000.00. The difference between
these amounts represents the value of
the inmates’ labor and the product of
the institution used in its construction.
No mechanical superintendents were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
employed, our officers acting in the
dual capacity of guards and instructors,
the inmates performing all the
labor, even the plumbing, electrical
work, and, in fact, all of the labor required
to finish the well-constructed
up-to-date building. The center corridor
is 260 feet long by 30 feet in
width, which we converted into a dining
hall. All the prisoners occupying
cells in the building have their meals
served in this space and the tables and
benches used for this purpose are also
used for carrying on religious and educational
work among the inmates during
the evening or on Sundays. This
is an entirely new innovation in prison
management, but is being carried on
with success.</p>

<p>The many advantages of a cell house
like this one, built on the plan of the
center corridor, are becoming more and
more apparent as they are put into
practical use. The outside window in
each cell goes a long way toward preventing
the spread of that dreaded disease,
tuberculosis. Light and airy cells
not only mean sanitary conditions, but
afford an opportunity for the inmates
to look out through windows and over
walls and witness natural, if not pleasant
scenes, which have a tendency to
inspire them with more wholesome
thoughts than if their gaze rested continually
upon stone walls and iron bars.
The entertainment of wholesome
thoughts is much more apt to be an
inspiration to better citizenship than
can be suggested by dismal surroundings.</p>

<p>The experience we have had in this
cell house has shown that the objections
raised by some to a style of construction
that would permit the prisoners
sitting in cells facing each other
across a center corridor is not justified.
We have had no difficulty whatever
because of this. The discipline maintained
has been of a higher order than
in the old-style cell houses and has
been obtained with comparative ease.
It is the intention of the management
of this institution to prevail upon the
city authorities to grant an appropriation
for a series of cell houses built on
the center corridor plan to take the
place of the old-style ones.</p>

<p>Society nowadays expects more of
the management of penal institutions
than merely to keep its inmates safely.
Some inmates may be lacking only
in moral or religious training; with
others it may be of the utmost importance
that they receive medical or surgical
attention; and again, educational
advantages often prove to be just the
needed inspiration to the unfortunate.
Proper physical or mental development
is nowadays acknowledged to be
the panacea for the delinquent youth,
and to some extent the adult. The consideration
of these facts will tend to
inspire the inmates with at least a
wholesome respect for the law, and I
believe that a more helpful discipline
can be maintained among the inmates
when they can be satisfied that something
is being done for their benefit and
enlightenment. This has been proved
to be true in the handling of the delinquent
youth in our modern institutions
who are no longer looked upon
as or called criminals, but young men
who can be developed into good citizenship,
by first determining their
needs and then finding ways and means
of supplying them.</p>

<p>In my opinion what has been done
for the youth can also be accomplished
in a large measure with the adult, especially
in a corrective institution such
as this. The discipline in a corrective
institution must necessarily be exacting
but at the same time it should be
permeated with that degree of kindness
that would inspire the prisoner to his
best efforts with the feeling that not
only the right but the beneficial thing
is being done for him. The law commits
to our keeping the undisciplined,
the unsocialized and the lawless, who
have perhaps never realized the importance
of self-control. The discipline
maintained among this class by
creating only a fear of punishment will
in most cases fail to bring about results
that are beneficial; such discipline
does not prove to be correctional, but
on the contrary has the tendency to
encourage the practice of deception,
for often they have no other incentive
when violating the rules than to show
that they can avoid detection. It
seems to me that discipline to be corrective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
should be instructive and educational;
instructive to a degree that
would satisfy the prisoner that the law is
not revengeful, but that in restraining
him from his liberty it wants to point
out to him his weaknesses and to assist
him in overcoming them; and educational
to a degree that would teach
him to formulate rules to govern himself
so that he might become a useful
member of society. Then he will be
more apt to consider the rules made to
govern his conduct while in prison as
really for his good, and he will co-operate
with them to such an extent, at
least, that he does not resort to deception.
If a prisoner can be taught the
lesson of self-control he is better prepared
to adapt himself to the outside
world and to good citizenship. If all
inmates are not susceptible to this form
of discipline, a sufficiently large percent
respond, and when the great number
of first offenders in an institution
of this kind is considered, it is well
worth an extra effort to maintain a
discipline that will appeal to them with
beneficial results to the community.</p>

<p>In my estimation, it is highly important
in an institution of this kind
to be prepared to give the best of medical
or surgical treatment to those of
the inmates who need it. We have a
medical department well equipped with
all the facilities of a first-class hospital.
The regular staff of that department
consists of four physicians and two
trained nurses who live on the grounds,
besides specialists who visit the institution
at regular intervals. In addition
to this we have a staff of consulting
surgeons and physicians, each of whom
visit the department at least once a
week. No better attention is given
patients in any hospital than our inmates
receive. From fifty to seventy-five
major operations are performed
each month by as competent surgeons
as there are in the city. The results
obtained in this department have been
most gratifying, and tend to prove that
if permanent progress is to be made in
the matter of the management of penal
institutions, much assistance must
come from a well regulated medical department,
where the mental condition
of the inmates is considered as well as
the physical.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_AMERICAN_JAIL_PROBLEM">THE AMERICAN JAIL PROBLEM</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frederick H. Wines, Secretary Illinois State Board of Administration.</span></p>

<p>[If the discussion which has followed the meeting of the International Prison Congress in Washington last October
has brought anything clearly to the surface, it is that the county jail system of this country has succeeded in turning
upon itself the spot-light of Europe. Why should we not take advantage of this borrowed illumination to become
familiar with our own problem?—Editor.]</p>


<p>The following extracts give the gist
of an interesting study of our jail system
which was read before the last
Maryland State conference of charities,
and recently published in <i>The Institution
Quarterly</i> of the Board of Administration
of Illinois.</p>

<p>“So much has been said, and so well
said, regarding the folly and iniquity
of the county jail system in the United
States, that it seems like a waste of
breath to discuss it further....
No fault can be found with any one
jail, that may not be found with scores
or hundreds of others. There are jails
that are too large, and jails that are too
small; insecure jails, unsanitary jails,
jails without light, jails without heat,
jails without ventilation, filthy jails,
jails that are not properly governed,
palatial jails, and jails that are not fit
for occupation as stables or pigstyes. I
suppose that I have personally inspected
nearly or quite one-fourth of all the
jails in this country, and my attention
has been drawn to every form of defect
and disgrace by which a county prison
can he disfigured.... But in
what forum is the case to be tried?
Who is to exercise the necessary jurisdiction?
Where is the jury charged
with the duty of rendering a verdict?
Who will select the jurors? and when?
and where?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“It is not difficult, where the conditions
in some county jail are shown to
be shameful and intolerable, to arouse
local sentiment in favor of some measure
of improvement. If it is overcrowded,
build an addition. If it is filthy,
inaugurate a general house-cleaning.
If it is unsafe, make it stronger. If it is
unsanitary, it is easy to supply artificial
light and heat, or to put in sewerage,
water and modern plumbing. With
these and other changes, it will do. If
not, or if the sheriff needs a fine official
residence, and the town wants a handsome
public building and profitable
contracts for its erection, then it may
be possible to bring about the construction
of a new prison.</p>

<p>“But what does all this really
amount to? In all the essentials of
good prison organization and management,
the new jail is no better than the
old one; and the money spent upon it is
simply an addition to the immense investment
in a wretched and indefensible
system. Instead of being an aid
to reform, it is an obstacle to reform.
It increases the weight of the already
too heavy burden resting on the
shoulders of the friends and advocates
of the thorough and effectual reconstruction
of our existing prison system,
from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p>“It would therefore seem to be high
time for a radical change in our method
of attack. We must adopt a new plan
of campaign, which will aim not at
the capture here and there of an outwork,
so much as at the occupation and
destruction of the innermost citadel.</p>

<p>“... Does any one imagine that
the abuses at which I have barely hinted
could long survive, if all convicted
offenders, major and minor, misdemeanants
as well as felons, were in the
custody of state instead of county officials?
The initial result would be a
diminution in the number of prisons.
There are many times too many local
prisons. Some of them stand empty
from year to year; some are overcrowded,
at least during the weeks
immediately preceding a term of the
criminal court. The needless multiplication
of jails entails a heavy pecuniary
burden upon the people.</p>

<p>“The massing of sentenced prisoners
would admit of their classification,
and of the introduction of reformatory
methods of dealing with them—useful,
healthy occupation both for body and
mind, and some measure of education
and religious influence.</p>

<p>“The officers in immediate charge
would naturally be men of higher
grade, their tenure of office would be
more secure, and they would have no
other duties to distract their attention
from their proper work. They would
have little time or opportunity for pernicious
political activity. They could
be better paid.</p>

<p>“The corrupt fee system, under
which it is to the pecuniary interest of
some official that arrests should be multiplied,
would go by the board.</p>

<p>“We might hope to see the last of
iron cages, and foreigners could no
longer satirize our prisons under the
generic term of menageries. The state
would avail itself of the services of
competent architects, and traveling
salesmen would not be able to sell to
unsuspecting and simple-minded commissioners
and supervisors their illusory
spectacles in shagreen cases.</p>

<p>“In a word, we should have an opportunity
to replace irresponsible by
responsible prison management, and
competency would in time take the
place of incompetency.</p>

<p>“This proposal implies, of course, the
complete and final disseverance of the
prison for men convicted of crime from
the house of detention for those awaiting
trial, whose guilt is yet unproven,
and who may be innocent. From the
days of Plato to the present moment,
that has been a cardinal maxim of
prison reform. The jail system has
prevented the realization of this ideal.</p>

<p>“It is not the house of correction,
but the house of detention, which constitutes
the most refractory element in
this complex problem. Let us lay that
portion of it aside, for the moment, and
consider the other, which is easier.
There is no practical obstacle to the
establishment of one or more state
houses of correction in any state, except
the indifference of the legislature;
and that can be overcome by a campaign
of education....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“The point is to insist that the condemned
misdemeanant, like the condemned
felon, shall be committed to
the custody of the state, which alone
shall have the power to execute upon
him, the sentence of the court. This
simple measure may be relied upon to
do away with one-half of our present
grounds of complaint.</p>

<p>“I have no fear that, this first step
taken, the state will not, sooner or
later, see its way clear to take a second,
and a third, and as many other steps
as may from time to time appear to be
expedient and practicable. ‘I do not
ask to see the distant scene; one step
enough for me.’</p>

<p>“I confess that I do not see how, at
present, it is possible to dispense with
the county jail as a house of detention.
Ill-adapted as it is to that use, if we
gain nothing, we at least lose nothing
by conservatism as to this point. Consider
the absolute necessity for having
a place of confinement for prisoners
awaiting trial. Consider the enormous
cost of providing a new and improved
house of detention in each county. If
it should be said that so many houses
of detention are not requisite, that the
state might be redistricted for judicial
purposes, or that prisoners might be
carried back and forth between counties,
remember that the witnesses
would also have to be transported, at
great expense. Neither of these suggestions
is likely favorably to impress
a practical mind. Possibly there are
jails which might be remodelled, so as
to serve reasonably well as houses of
detention only; and there may be counties
in which the present jails should be
condemned as nuisances, and houses of
detention, properly planned for that
exclusive use, might there be built.
These are details which may be left to
take care of themselves. Why put off
doing what we can do, because there
are other things that we can not do?
The time may come when we can do
more. Why advocate reforms which
are sure to provoke such a united opposition
as to insure their defeat in
advance?</p>

<p>“On this subject, however, there is
one suggestion that may well be made.
The population of our minor prisons
might be materially reduced, if a more
liberal use were made of the constitutional
right of bail. The purpose of
temporary release under bond is twofold;
to relieve the public and to relieve
the prisoner. It is expected that the
courts will exercise this power in a
liberal spirit, and they do. Some of
them are authorized to release prisoners
on their own recognizance, at the
discretion of the court. Every court
should possess this right, and greater
use might well be made of it. In our
large cities, there are many persons
guilty of disorderly conduct, or charged
with the violation of some police regulation,
or some trivial or purely technical
offence, who would face trial,
without being held in custody, but are
unable to procure bondsmen. In both
civic and rural communities, there
are also many whose family and business
relations are such, that there is
no reason to apprehend that they will
seek to avoid trial by running away.
The fact that such persons can not furnish
bail is no sufficient reason for their
imprisonment. In all such cases, the
committing magistrate must of course
use wise discrimination in the exercise
of his right to waive the usual bail-bond.</p>

<p>“It is further desirable that the criminal
code should provide for the probation
of the accused, in advance of trial.</p>

<p>“By the adoption of these and other
similar methods, fewer men and women
would be exposed to the peril of moral
contagion in prison, which, under our
present system, affects even those who
may be, and in fact often are, innocent.
Moreover, it is an error to imagine that
all who are guilty of the charges for
which, under the statutes, if unable to
pay a reasonable fine, they must endure
a term of incarceration, are depraved.
The boy who throws a ball through a
plate glass window and is caught, is no
worse than the boy who does the same
thing and makes his escape without
being arrested; nor the boy who can
pay a fine, than the boy who can not.”</p>

</div>


<h3>NEW HAMPSHIRE SOCIETY
    AFTER STATE REFORMATORY</h3>

<p>At the session of the New Hampshire
Legislature which adjourned on
April 15, the New Hampshire Prisoners’
Aid Association co-operated with
the State Conference of Charities and
Corrections and the State Federation
of Women’s Clubs in the advancing of
two measures which were deemed of
immediate importance to the State.</p>

<p>The first of these was a resolution
calling upon the Governor to appoint
special commission of three members
to investigate and report to the legislature,
at its next session, in 1913, on
the desirability of a State Workhouse
or Reformatory. The resolution, which
carries a sufficient appropriation to pay
the expenses of the investigation, passed
the legislature and received the signature
of the Governor. A similar
measure presented at three previous
sessions met with defeat, owing to the
false impression that a central state
reformatory would mean additional
cost to the taxpayers. This impression
was weakened by the arguments
before committees that the assembling
of all minor offenders in one institution
would make it possible to put them
at some profitable industry and in the
end save money. At present minor offenders
are confined in about 20 county
jails and houses of correction, in only
one of which is there a population sufficient
to operate an industry. In nine
of the jails idleness is the rule. In the
remaining institutions the prisoners
are dependent upon work about the
buildings and upon the farm, and when
this work is slackest the prisons are
fullest. It is hoped that the study of
the commission will result in recommendations
whose execution by the
next legislature will in New Hampshire
do away with the evils of the locally
administered jail and house of
correction.</p>

<p>The second item on the program was
a bill providing for medical inspection
by the state board of health of all penal
institutions, and for thorough examination
of all prisoners, at the times of
committal and discharge, not only with
reference to their present physical and
mental condition, but also with reference
to their personal and family history
as to mental capacity and delinquency.
This measure was felt to be
important, aside from its immediate advantage
in institutional administration,
in two respects: (1) It would undoubtedly
bring about some changes in
classifying and treating offenders; and
(2) the careful recording of the results
of the examinations would probably in
the course of years build up a mass of
data from which it would be possible
to draw inferences as to methods of preventing
delinquency. This bill was not
put into presentable shape until so late
in the session that it failed of favorable
consideration. The chief opposition
came from those who believed that the
cost of careful medical examinations
in county institutions would be such as
materially to raise the budget for the
hospital departments. On the contrary,
the warden of the state prison
testified that the result of such examinations
as have been voluntarily adopted
by him has been a lessening in the
expenses of the hospital department.
The centralization of minor offenders
in a state reformatory will facilitate the
adoption of this needed reform.</p>

<p>Similarly it will probably be easier
to get a system of probation for adult
offenders if there is a state reformatory.
The Prisoners’ Aid Association
pressed a probation bill two years ago
and failed. This year the measure was
held in abeyance so as to give the more
fundamental bill the right of way. A
state penal board has for many years
been desired by many. This too, would
logically follow state control of minor
offenders. So the Association feels that
the first battle has been won in the
wider campaign. The next battle, and
the decisive one, if we win it, will be
that concerning the actual establishment
of the state reformatory.</p>

<h3>A GREAT BRITAIN PLAN</h3>

<p>Mr. Winston Churchill’s attempt
to lighten the load which every discharged
convict has as a handicap
in his efforts to retrieve his position
will be watched with much interest
in all Anglo-Saxon countries. A new
commission is to be organized, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the financial and moral backing of
the government, for the purpose of
uniting and directing the efforts of all
societies which have as their common
purpose the opening of opportunities
for legitimate activity to men who have
made a mistake and paid the penalty
for it. The Home Secretary is to be at
its head and, while its scope has not yet
been and possibly never will be definitely
delimited, it will make possible
the abolition of police supervision
which has been one of the almost insuperable
obstacles in the path of every
ex-prisoner who tried to live down his
past in Great Britain. Police officers,
as a rule, are too actively engaged in
the militant work of fighting crime to
be able to share in the task of rehabilitating
the vanquished. We have not,
in Canada, the problems in this connection
which Great Britain has to
solve but we have enough reasons for
fearing that they will come with our
rapid development to make our interest
in the new movement more than an impersonal
one.—Montreal (Que.) Star.</p>

<h3>THE PAROLE
SYSTEM AS IT WORKS</h3>

<p>Joseph T. Byers, now the Secretary
of the New Jersey State Charities Aid
and Prison Reform Association, developed,
while he was superintendent of
the New York House of Refuge, the
parole system of that institution to a
high degree. In his final report to the
board of managers of the House of Refuge
he said:</p>

<p>“The most important work of the institution
is that of our parole department.
It has been a source of great
gratification to me, as I am sure it has
been also to the board, to note the development
and success of this work.
Convinced that short parole periods of
supervision were unwise, our work was
organized on a basis of supervision that
should last as long as the law permitted,
namely, during minority. To those
who would criticise this period as being
excessive and likely to work hardship
to the boys, to make them restive and
intolerant, I can only say that close observation
during the past five years
does not warrant any such statement.
The monthly reports of the boys have
been made, as a rule, very promptly
and satisfactorily. They have not
shown any great desire to be released
from parole supervision; and I present
as further evidence of the fact that our
parole supervision has been properly
adjusted, the more than fifteen hundred
visits made to me during the past
twelve months by paroled boys. Three-quarters
of these visits were purely voluntary
on the part of the boys. The
credit for this condition of affairs is
largely due to the parole officers. They
have been tactful, sympathetic, resourceful
and in every way deserving of
the full confidence I have had in their
integrity and efficiency.</p>

<p>Two thousand five hundred and five
boys have been actually under supervision.
Of these, 914 are still reporting
and doing well, and 237 were doing
well when supervision expired; 1073
have for one reason or another been unsatisfactory
on parole. Of these 791
have been returned to the institution
(including 56 voluntary returns); 154
have been committed to other institutions
or are now on trial, and in 128
cases supervision expired with the boys
not doing well. In 281 cases out of
2505 nothing is at present known. This
means that 11.21 per cent. of our boys
are out of touch with the institution,
having left home, family moved, or for
some other cause. Five hundred and
six boys have attained their majority
and have therefore passed from under
supervision. At the time of expiration
237 of the 506 were doing well; 128
were doing badly, or were at the time
in other institutions; while in 141 cases
no information was at hand. It is only
fair to state that of this latter number
(141), 80 are boys who were paroled
before October, 1905, which was before
adequate parole supervision had been
established. Taking only the cases of
these 506 boys who have graduated
from our supervision, present records
enable us to account for only 46.84 per
cent. who were known to be doing well.
In making this statement we are not
crediting ourselves with probable satisfactory
cases; any boy concerning
whom definite information is not at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
hand is placed in the unsatisfactory
class.</p>

<p>Short parole periods are a fallacy.
Of the 202 boys returned for violation
of parole, 49 were out of the institution
more than a year and 18 of them more
than two years.</p>

<p>Thirty-six per cent. of 202 delinquents
were returned for crime (burglary,
larceny, forgery, robbery, picking
pockets, and receiving stolen
property). Of the total number of
Protestant boys on parole 09.26 per
cent. were returned for violation; of
the whole number of Catholic boys,
14.04 per cent.; of the Jewish boys
14.66 per cent.</p>

<h3>PAROLE LAW
ADOPTED IN TEXAS</h3>

<p>The new parole law in Texas embodies
the following important features: A
board of prison commissioners acting as
a board of parole; eligibility for parole
when the minimum sentence has expired;
the retaking by the employes of
the board of delinquent paroled men;
meetings of parole board when necessary;
opportunity for each prisoner at
expiration to appear in person or before
board; merit system of recording
prisoner’s life and conduct during
term; absolute release at discretion of
board; agent for employment and supervision;
delinquent paroled prisoner
to be regarded in same light as escaped
prisoner.</p>

<p>“When a convict who has been paroled
shall have complied with the
rules and conditions governing his
parole until the end of the term to
which he was sentenced, he shall upon
a written or printed discharge by the
board of prison commissioners, setting
forth these facts, be entitled to a restoration
of his citizenship by the Governor
of the State of Texas.”</p>

<p><i>Convicts Put at Road Making.</i>—With
the coming of open weather the question
of the relation of convicts to road
making is reviving in different parts of
the country.</p>

<p>W. M. Gammon, Rome, Ga., chairman
of the Board of Commissioners
Roads and Revenue, Floyd County,
writes to the Manufacturers’ Record:</p>

<p>“The road from Rome to Chattanooga
will be a graded macadamized
road, with concrete-steel bridges over
all streams and concrete culverts over
all drains. Through Floyd county it
will be of the same class as that of the
government road through the Chickamauga
Park to Lafayette in Walker
county, with which this road will connect.</p>

<p>“The road will be built with convict
labor. This county has two gangs of
50 convicts each, 60 mules, seven road
graders, two traction engines, with
teams of steel cars and road rollers.
The bridges and culverts will be built
by a bridge gang of trained convicts.
These convicts have become really experts
in this line and will construct the
bridges at about one-half the contract
price. In fact, we find the concrete culverts
with this labor about the cheapest
we can build—about $3 per cubic
yard. With this gang we have built
over 30 miles of this class of roads the
past 18 months, 30 concrete-steel
bridges and 120 concrete culverts.</p>

<p>“If all the States would adopt the
Georgia convict system, we would in a
few years revolutionize road building
in the South and have first-class roads
from the Potomac to Mexico.</p>

<p>“Chattanooga county and Walker
county will only have about 16 miles
to build of this road, and they propose
to connect with our road and the Government
road at Lafayette.</p>

<p>“This county has already built two
roads of this character from Rome to
the Alabama line, and with the co-operation
of the Alabama counties expect
to continue them to Birmingham. This
county will also complete this summer
one road to Polk county and another
to Barlow, and with the co-operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of the other counties expects to continue
the roads to Atlanta.</p>

<p>“We expect in the near future to
have a through line from Chattanooga
to Birmingham and Atlanta, passing
through Rome. We advocate putting
all convicts on the roads, and when the
people understand the great benefits
to be derived from this work we will
soon have a splendid highway from
Washington through Virginia, Tennessee
and Georgia to the Gulf Coast in
Florida.”</p>

<p>The new Kansas law allowing the
prisoners of county jails to work on
roads will greatly relieve congestion in
the Wyandotte county jail, save that
county thousands of dollars and improve
the roads.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of Wyandotte
county are planning to have steel cages
built, each one to hold four “bunks,” to
care for the prisoners while they are
working in the quarries and on the
roads. In this way the men can work
eight or nine hours a day and no time
will be consumed in bringing them to
and from the jail. The cages will be
built on wheels, so that they can be
drawn from place to place.</p>

<p><i>George Junior Republic During 1910</i>—The
annual report for 1910 of the
George Junior Republic, Freeville, N.
Y., looking, with its pictures of open
cottages and stretches of unwalled
country, like a real estate company’s
advertisement of rural sites, or the
prospectus of a summer camp, is out.
One imagines, as he reads, that he has
in hand not the annual statement of an
institution for delinquents, but a breezy
report on the growth of a modern village,
or a pamphlet boosting some
“Summerville—1915” movement.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1910, there were 137
“citizens” in the George Junior Republic.
A “citizen” is simply an inmate.
During the year there had been discharged
89 boys and girls, and just the
same number had been received. With
the exception of four, concerning whom
it is not stated how they were received,
the report shows that these had been
taken in either for delinquency or for
improper guardianship, from poor officers,
from parents or guardians, or by
their own application. Eleven are listed
as having been received for delinquency,
and 15 by their own application.</p>

<p>The Republic is a training school for
all classes of boys and girls. The only
qualifications for membership are
sound minds and bodies—no mental defectives
or cripples, deformed or sickly
children are retained—and an age of
at least 14 years. The Republic is a
big farm of 350 acres, having upon it
a modern village with its own system of
water, sewerage, steam heat, roadways,
and cement walks. Perhaps the two
main reasons for its interest to most
people are its form of government, with
legislative, judicial, and executive departments,
and the independent basis
of self-support which every boy and
girl within its bounds is obliged to
maintain.</p>

<p>It has often been said that a successful
school in the George Junior Republic
was an impossibility because of the
heterogeneous character and training of
the pupils. From 1896 to 1905, a school
for elementary pupils was maintained.
In the latter year was opened what is
known as the Hunt Memorial School.
Later a high school was added. In
June, 1910, regents’ diplomas were
awarded to the first class of graduates
from this high school. Four of the
students entered college without conditions.
The examinations in 1910
showed a decided academic awakening
among the students. In June, 1910, the
first prizes in the Owasco Valley prize
speaking contest were awarded to a
boy and girl from the Hunt Memorial
School of George Junior Republic.</p>

<p>Existing without State aid, and with
endowments which give an income of
only $1,151, the Republic faced, on September
30, 1910, a deficit of $14,647.75.</p>

<p>In January, 1911, was opened a large
gymnasium, the gift of friends of the
Republic.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><i>Some Bad Conditions in North Carolina</i>—That
all the county convict camps
of the state be placed under a state
board of supervisors is a recommendation
embodied in the annual report for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
1910, just issued, of the Board of Public
Charities of North Carolina. Thirty-nine
counties maintain these camps.
Reports of the county commissioners
show that in 17 of these counties the
prisoners in the camps are chained together
at night. Sixteen counties report
that whipping, administered usually
by the superintendent or foreman,
is resorted to as a form of punishment
in the camps.</p>

<p>The report urges also that the burden
of executing the conditional release,
or parole law, be lifted from the
Governor, on whom it now rests, and
placed upon the prison board of directors,
who should be made a parole board
with power to release conditionally
every prisoner except those sentenced
for life.</p>

<p>Concerning the county jails in the
state, the report says:</p>

<p>“Generally speaking, the prisoners
are not kept in as cleanly a condition as
they should be. The bedding and cells
more particularly should be especially
cleansed whenever not occupied and
ready for the next comer. The great
difficulty is the fact that prisoners wear
their own old clothing into the jail and
thus introduce dirt and vermin which
require a continual fight from those in
charge. A limited number of suits
could be provided by the county and
the men required to bathe and put
these on while their own are fumigated.
There is no excuse for the filth in some
of our jails.”</p>

    <hr class="r5" />

<p><i>English Progress</i>—In the Providence
(R. I.) Sunday Journal, of April 9th,
the London correspondent of that
paper quotes Thomas Holmes, Secretary
of the Howard Association of London,
as follows:</p>

<p>“If some of the American methods
were grafted on to the English prison
administration, the effect would work
remarkably for good. I found that their
probation system was worked much
more effectively and thoroughly than
it is in England. Their probation officers
are fitted absolutely for the work.
On this side there are no paid probation
officers as such; they are either
voluntary workers or servants of some
charitable society, not state officials.
At present we are only playing with
the probation idea in England. If we
could get men of character and capability,
occupying fairly well-paid posts,
we should have better results than you
have in America.”</p>

<p>Secretary Holmes went on to say
that in his opinion the weakness in the
position of the American probation officers
resided in the fact that the judges
made the appointments. If the probation
officer was a strong man he influenced
the judge too much, and if a
weak man he was apt to become
creature of the judge.</p>

<p>He feels strongly that England is
following the lead of America, slowly
but surely, in the development of the
parole system, though no legislation
has as yet been passed in this direction.</p>

<p>“We are getting tired of judges inflicting
very long sentences—practically
life sentences,” he says. “There is
a constant agitation always going on
behind the scenes to get sentence commuted.
Again and again the Home
Secretary—whom I know and respect—has
to reconsider the sentences prisoners
are serving. This puts him in a
delicate position. He has to consult
the judges who passed the sentences.
If the Home Secretary commutes the
sentence it is a snub to the judge.</p>

<p>“What we want in England at each
prison is a board, consisting of the
governor, chaplain, doctor, a representative
of the Home Office and one or
two visiting justices. They should
have the power of releasing on parole
any prisoner whose condition warranted
that concession. But the American
Board of Parole is not comprehensive
enough; it is too much in the
hands of one or two.”</p>

<p>The mercantile element in some of
the American State prisons came in for
some adverse criticism, but in the matters
of greater space, better buildings,
better equipped workshops, greater
variety and volume of work and more
recreation and education for the prisoners,
the American State jails, said Secretary
Holmes, are superior to the
English. But in the construction and
appointment of the local county jails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
he thinks the advantage lies with the
English models.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><i>“Twice Born Men;” A Brief Review</i>—Prisoner’s
aid workers will do well
to read Harold Begbie’s book, “Twice
Born Men.” It is a striking psychological
study of men who have sounded
the depths of human degredation and
misfortune. Its chief practical value
to those who are dealing daily with all
sorts and conditions of men, will be in
throwing light on a checkered past
which is often only partly revealed by
the applicants themselves.</p>

<p>The reader may feel that the author
holds a brief for the Salvation Army
and its work. One might suppose that
he was unconscious of any other religious
work being done, except for the
fact that he specifically discredits the
efficacy of the ordinary prison chaplain’s
work. It is probably true that
the average chaplain might not have
sufficient patience with the particular
type of man with whom Mr. Begbie
deals in this book. We cannot forget,
however, that this is only one of many
varieties of human experience, and the
average prison chaplain might be far
more effective than any one else with
the larger number of men whom the
Army might regard as “Hopelessly
Good,” but who nevertheless need the
regenerating and sustaining power of
religion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this seeming limitation
of the book, “Twice Born Men” is
a splendid portrayal of the one more or
less uniform type of the anti-social individual.
We are especially impressed
with the fact that the materials for this
book were secured almost within a
stone’s throw of the aristocratic West
End of London. It is almost inconceivable
that a cultured community would
permit the continuance of such a festering
sore at its very heels. Fortunately
few American cities have such dangerous
proximity of the more healthful
districts to its insanitary cesspools.
May we not take hope from the fact
that with a wider separation between
the Avenue and the congested district
the American cities are insisting upon
the extermination of the latter? Their
darkness is being expelled by the substitution
of social settlements for saloons,
and parks and playgrounds for
penny-ante and gambling dens.</p>

<p>No reader of “Twice Born Men” can
fail to have his faith quickened in the
possibilities of human reclamation.
Wide experience may discover not only
one but many motives that will prompt
the transformation of different sorts of
men. Nevertheless it gives a renewed
courage to feel that when there has
been apparent failure all along the line,
and when all the resources of church
and state have been ineffective in preventing
men from reaching the lowest
dregs of humanity, there remains the
unusual and striking method of the Salvation
Army in its appeal to the deep-seated
and imperishable instinct of religion.</p>

<p><i>Washington Strives for Inebriates
Hospital.</i>—The various citizens’ associations
of Washington, D. C., will be asked
to make a concerted effort to induce Congress
to establish a hospital for inebriates
and victims of the drug habit, to which
persons can be sent for treatment or be
lawfully committed, so that they can be
restrained from access to either intoxicating
liquors or injurious drugs. The
board of trade and chamber of commerce
also will be urged to take up the matter.</p>

<p>The Washington Evening Star says
editorially: “The need of a local hospital
as a place of special treatment for inebriates
has long been known and admitted
in Washington. The present practice of
confining dipsomaniacs and drug victims
in a penal institution is suggestive of a
bygone age. These unfortunates need
treatment, judicious encouragement and
some measure of restraint. But what
they do not need is punishment. The
workhouse is not the best place for alcoholic
slaves, but the District is under the
necessity of sending them there.”</p>

    <hr class="r5" />

<p>The Iowa legislature is considering a
bill which provides that while the inmates
of the state prison and reformatory
are at hard labor and on good behavior,
their wives and children under
sixteen years of age shall be paid fifty
cents a day by the state.</p>
